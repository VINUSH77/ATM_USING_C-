# ATM_USING_C++
An ATM (Automated Teller Machine) is an electronic banking system that allows customers to perform various financial transactions without the need for a human teller. In this project, C++ programming language is used to create an ATM system.
The system consists of a main menu that allows customers to choose from various options, such as checking account balance, withdrawing money, and depositing money. The system validates the user's input and checks the user's account information to perform the requested transaction.
The project involves using various C++ concepts such as conditional statements, loops, functions, and classes. The system stores user information such as account number, PIN, and account balance in a file or database.
Overall, this project provides a practical implementation of C++ concepts in a real-world scenario and helps to improve the programmer's problem-solving and programming skills.
